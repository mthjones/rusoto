//! Rusoto is an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) SDK for Rust.
//! A high level overview is available in `README.md` at https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The following code shows a simple example of using Rusoto's DynamoDB API to
//! list the names of all tables in a database.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use std::default::Default;
//!
//! use rusoto::{DefaultCredentialsProvider, Region};
//! use rusoto::dynamodb::{DynamoDbClient, ListTablesInput};
//!
//! let provider = DefaultCredentialsProvider::new().unwrap();
//! let client = DynamoDbClient::new(provider, Region::UsEast1);
//! let list_tables_input: ListTablesInput = Default::default();
//!
//! match client.list_tables(&list_tables_input) {
//!     Ok(output) => {
//!         match output.table_names {
//!             Some(table_name_list) => {
//!                 println!("Tables in database:");
//!
//!                 for table_name in table_name_list {
//!                     println!("{}", table_name);
//!                 }
//!             },
//!             None => println!("No tables in database!"),
//!         }
//!     },
//!     Err(error) => {
//!         println!("Error: {:?}", error);
//!     },
//! }
